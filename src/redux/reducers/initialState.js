        " One hour of tennis burns 600 calories, putting it on par with jogging and cycling as one of the best aerobic activities. All the little sprints, pivots, slams, and serves in tennis also channel your strength and require you to exert energy in short but powerful bursts.",

        "The typical season for cycling takes place during May and June where millions of events and races take place every year globally. You don’t need to be trying to win the Maillot Jaune to get into this great sport. Cycling classes are fun and available everywhere. Cycling is a low-impact way to burn serious calories, but it also makes you happier and makes your brain stronger. Dr. Aurthur Kramer said of cycling: “Our research finds that after only three months, people who exercised had the brain volume of those three years younger.”",

      article:
        "To get the ball rolling, let’s begin with your sleep patterns. This is without a doubt the most powerful of all our healthy habits. You can’t function without proper sleep. Don’t believe me? Did you know that no matter which bodily need you are trying to serve (be it hunger or thirst or desire or what-have-you), if your body needs sleep badly enough it will literally override all the others and you will collapse on the ground where you stood and immediately fall asleep? Did you know that? Even if you were actively being attacked! I personally know at least one Navy SEAL who slept while being shot at! Now, to be fair to him, he actively made the choice to go to sleep—but still! It shows you that the body needs what the body needs.",

        "Still in the arena of your health, we have your diet coming in at number 3 on our list of healthy habits. There are some super simple rules here. Drink more water. It doesn’t matter how much water you drink now. Drink more. It’s good for you. If you drink a cold glass first thing in the morning you will lose weight (see: giant write-up in the 4-hour body by Tim Ferris) and you will also wake up with a clear, alert mind. Second, cut out sugar. If you can completely avoid adding sugar to your drinks or food, you will have done wonderful things for your body, metabolically speaking. We have full articles on the site about this so I won’t delve too deeply here. I’ll just link you to them. Third, eat mindfully. If you can eat more slowly—more consciously—it can actually improve your perception of the flavor (and who doesn’t want better-tasting food?).",

        "Gymnastics requires athletes to be flexible, strong, and in great shape. Each time a gymnast steps into the gym they are called on to use all of their mental and physical facilities to win the competition. That’s because participation in gymnastics does not only offer physical gains; it is beneficial for improving concentration and mental focus. Gymnastics allows children the chance to think for themselves, to stimulate their imaginations and to solve problems safely.",
